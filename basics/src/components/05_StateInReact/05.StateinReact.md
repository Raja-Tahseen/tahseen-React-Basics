## 1. Simple Counter App

Here's a complete counter app using React's `useState` hook:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setCount(0);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## 2. Why We Use State in React

State is used in React for several important reasons:

1. **Component Memory:** State allows components to remember and manage information between renders.

2. **Dynamic UI:** It enables components to update and re-render when data changes, creating interactive user interfaces.

3. **Single Source of Truth:** State provides a centralized place to store data that affects what's rendered.

4. **Reactivity:** When state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect those changes.

5. **Isolation:** State is local to each component instance, allowing for reusable components with independent data.

6. Without state, components would be static and unable to respond to user interactions or data changes.

## 3. What Happens When State Updates in React

When state updates in React, the following occurs:

1. **State Update Request:** When you call the state updater function (like setCount), React schedules a state update.

2. **Reconciliation Process:**

- React compares the new state with the previous state

- It determines what parts of the component need to change

3. **Re-rendering:**

- The component function is called again (re-rendered)

- All child components that depend on this state may also re-render (unless optimized)

4. **Virtual DOM Update:**

- React creates a new virtual DOM representation

- It performs a diff with the previous virtual DOM

5. **DOM Update:**

- React calculates the minimal set of changes needed

- It updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM

**Important notes:**

1. State updates are asynchronous - multiple setState calls may be batched

2. React uses Object.is comparison to determine if state actually changed

3. If state is the same as before, React may skip re-rendering that component

4. The previous state is replaced with the new state (unless using functional updates)
