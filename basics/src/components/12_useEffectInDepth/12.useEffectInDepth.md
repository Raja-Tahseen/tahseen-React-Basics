## 1. Fetching and Displaying API Data in React

Here's a complete example of fetching and displaying data from an API using React:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
        );
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
        }
        const jsonData = await response.json();
        setData(jsonData);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once on mount

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>API Data</h1>
      <ul>
        {data &&
          data.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>
              <h3>{item.title}</h3>
              <p>{item.body}</p>
            </li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DataFetcher;
```

## 2. Why useEffect Runs Twice in React Strict Mode

In React Strict Mode (enabled by default in newer React applications), `useEffect` may run twice in development for the following reasons:

**1. Intentional Behavior:** The React team added this to help identify:

- Impure effects that don't properly clean up

- Side effects that might cause issues in concurrent rendering

Memory leaks from missing cleanup functions

**2. Development-Only Feature:** This double-invocation only happens:

- In development mode

- When Strict Mode is enabled

- For components mounted for the first time

**3. How It Works: React will:**

- Mount the component

- Run effects

- Immediately unmount the component

- Mount it again

- Run effects again

**4. Purpose: This helps catch bugs where:**

- Effects aren't properly cleaned up on unmount

- Effects depend on external state that might change

- Effects perform operations that should be idempotent

**5. How to Handle It:**

- Ensure your effects have proper cleanup

- Make sure effects are idempotent (can run multiple times safely)

- If needed, use refs to track whether the effect has already run

Example of handling double effects:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("...");
    const data = await response.json();
    if (!ignore) {
      setData(data);
    }
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    ignore = true; // This will prevent state updates after unmount
  };
}, []);
```

Remember that this behavior doesn't occur in production builds - it's strictly a development aid to help you write more robust components.
