##### 3. Name three commonly used hooks in React.

## 1. Why class components are no longer preferred in React:

Class components are no longer the preferred approach in React because:

**1. Complexity:** They require more boilerplate code (e.g., `constructor`, `this` bindings, lifecycle methods).

**2. Harder to Reuse Logic:** Sharing stateful logic between components often requires complex patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs) or render props.

**3. Performance:** Class components can be harder to optimize due to how this and lifecycle methods work.

**4. Hooks Offer Simplicity:** Functional components with **Hooks** provide a cleaner, more intuitive way to manage state and side effects.

React now encourages **functional components with Hooks** as they are simpler, more composable, and avoid this-related confusion.

## 2. Problems Hooks solve in React:

Keys are important in React lists for several reasons:

**1. Reusing Stateful Logic:** Before Hooks, sharing logic between components required patterns like HOCs or render props, leading to "wrapper hell."

**2. Complex Components:** Class components often became hard to understand due to scattered lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`).

**3. Confusing this:** Managing this in class components was error-prone and required explicit binding.

**4. Better Code Organization:** Hooks let you split code by concerns (e.g., `useEffect` for side effects) instead of lifecycle methods.

## 3. Three commonly used React Hooks:

1. `useState` → Manages local state in functional components.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

2. `useEffect` → Handles side effects (e.g., API calls, subscriptions).

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [dependencies]);
```

3. `useContext` → Accesses React context without prop drilling.

```jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

Other popular hooks: `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.
